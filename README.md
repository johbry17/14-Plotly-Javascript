Development on this project has stopped.

## Description

Builds an interactive dashboard to dynamically explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) that offers a series of visualizations that depict the type of bacteria found in various people's belly buttons. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Usage

Use page link [here](https://johbry17.github.io/14-belly-button-biodiversity-plotly-javascript/). Choose from the dropdown menu to display different results for different test subjects.
